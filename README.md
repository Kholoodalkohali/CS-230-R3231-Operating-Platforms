# The Gaming Room Software Design Project

## Overview

This repository contains the software design documentation created for The Gaming Room's project to transition their Android-based game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based platform accessible across multiple devices. The documentation outlines the requirements, design constraints, system architecture, domain model, evaluation, and recommendations for the project.

## Contents

- **CS 230 Project Software Design Template**: This document serves as the main software design template for The Gaming Room project.

## Document Highlights

### Executive Summary

Summarizes the project objectives, proposed solution, and key considerations.

### Requirements

Details the business and technical requirements identified by the client.

### Design Constraints

Outlines the constraints imposed by the web-based distributed environment and platform considerations.

### System Architecture View

Provides insights into the system architecture and logical topology of the application.

### Domain Model

Presents the UML class diagram depicting the domain model of the game application.

### Evaluation

Evaluates characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of operating platforms and mobile devices.

### Recommendations

### Journal Entry

Explores client-server architecture in web-based game development.

## Reflection

- **Client and Requirements**: The Gaming Room client sought to transition their Android game into a web-based platform with specific requirements for multiple teams, unique identification mechanisms, cross-platform compatibility, robust memory and storage management, and security measures.
- **Documentation Development**: The documentation effectively articulated the client's requirements, proposed solutions, and architectural considerations.
- **Design Process**: The design document facilitated clarity on architectural requirements and enabled effective collaboration among team members.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Visual aids such as detailed diagrams could enhance understanding, especially in system architecture and domain modeling sections.
- **User-Centric Design**: Interpreting user needs and implementing them into the software design ensured alignment with user preferences and enhanced usability.

## Future Directions

- Explore prototyping, user testing, and iterative design methodologies for refining the software design process.
- Continuously update and iterate on the software design documentation based on evolving requirements and feedback.
